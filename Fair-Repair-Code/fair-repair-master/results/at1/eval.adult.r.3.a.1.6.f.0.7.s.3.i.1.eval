Problem MODEL has 120 rows, 20 columns and 230 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Continuous objective value is 1821.42 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 110 rows, 20 columns (20 integer (0 of which binary)) and 220 elements
Cutoff increment increased from 1e-05 to 0.9999
Cbc0012I Integer solution of 1825 found by DiveCoefficient after 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0006I The LP relaxation is infeasible or too expensive
Cbc0013I At root node, 0 cuts changed objective from 1821.4167 to 1824.4446 in 1 passes
Cbc0014I Cut generator 0 (Probing) - 1 row cuts average 3.0 elements, 5 column cuts (5 active)  in 0.000 seconds - new frequency is 1
Cbc0014I Cut generator 1 (Gomory) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.000 seconds - new frequency is -100
Cbc0014I Cut generator 2 (Knapsack) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.000 seconds - new frequency is -100
Cbc0014I Cut generator 3 (Clique) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.000 seconds - new frequency is -100

Cbc0014I Cut generator 5 (FlowCover) - 0 row cuts average 0.0 elements, 0 column cuts (0 active)  in 0.000 seconds - new frequency is -100
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 1825, took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 1821.42 to 1824.44
Probing was tried 1 times and created 6 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
