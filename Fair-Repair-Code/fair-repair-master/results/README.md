# FairRepair/results

The experiments are conducted on two datasets in the `data` folder. The experimental parameters contain:

- `fairness threshold`
- `alpha`
- `sensitive attribute`
- `random seed`

For adult dataset, there is an additional parameter:

- `dataset size`

For random forest, there is one more parameter:

- `forest size`

For each dataset, we ran experiments on different parameters to test various properties of our tool. In particular, the folders in this directory contains the following results.

- `gt` and `gf*`, German dataset
- `at` and `af*`, Adult dataset
- `ut` and `uf*`, UFRGS dataset
